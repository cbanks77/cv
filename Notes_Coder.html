I would like to be able to write code and other applications that are useful for my family.
So I am on a journey to make a web-site that is useful for my family and others.

Note:

html is the hyper text mark-up language

you can make tables with the table tag
<table></table> :Table
<tr></tr>		:Table Row
<td></td>		:Table data
<th></th>		:Table Header

<form>
<input type="text">
<input type="submit">
<input type="file">
<input type="date">
<input type="radio">
<input type="range">
</form>
</body>
</html>
